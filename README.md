# Malaysia-Weakpass-Wordlists
This is my research about common use passwords in **Malaysia**.

**This repository contains a curated collection of commonly used passwords in Malaysia, compiled from various research studies and reports. The aim is to provide a resource for security professionals, researchers, and educators to understand password usage patterns in Malaysia and to promote stronger password practices.**

**Overview**

Password security remains a critical concern in Malaysia. Studies have consistently shown that weak and easily guessable passwords are prevalent among Malaysian users. For instance, in 2023, "**123456**" emerged as the most commonly used password in the country. 

Other frequently used passwords include:

1. admin
2. password
3. 12345678
4. abcd1234
5. 000000
6. 23456789
7. abc123
